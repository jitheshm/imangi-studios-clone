                    <h1>We Are <br>
                        Imangi Studios</h1>

                    <p>
                        <strong>IN THE BEGINNING</strong>
                        … Imangi Studios was founded by husband and wife team Keith Shepherd and Natalia Luckyanova in
                        2008 with the goal of creating fun family-friendly games for everyone to enjoy! In 2011 the
                        studio developed the mega-hit Temple Run and in 2013 developed another mega-hit Temple Run 2.
                        Combined, these two games have been downloaded over 2.5 billion times. Imangi Studios has also
                        developed Temple Run: Brave (with Pixar), Temple Run: Oz (with Disney), Max Adventure and Harbor
                        Master.

                    <p>
                        <strong>TODAY</strong>
                        : Imangi has grown out of its startup phase and entered into its next phase, one of growth.
                        Imangi is now led by a team of industry veterans and focused on Publishing successful games,
                        Developing new Temple Run games, and forming partnerships with other companies.


                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This focus on growth has seen Imangi expand in terms of its team size, but also its strategy and
                        scope. Imangi is focused on growing and developing the Temple Run brand through a variety of
                        opportunities including new Mobile Games (both runner and non-runner) and beyond. Imangi is
                        developing a team and culture that reflects the Temple Run mantra of Fun, Wonder, Danger, and
                        Adventure!
